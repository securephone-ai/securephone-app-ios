/// A wrapper around key-value observing so that you:
///	1. don't need to implement `observeValue` yourself, you can instead handle changes in a closure
///	2. you get a `CallbackReason` for each change which includes `valueChanged`, `pathChanged`, `sourceDeleted`.
///	3. observation is automatically cancelled if you release the KeyValueObserver or the source is released
///
/// While Swift 4 offers an `observe(...) -> NSKeyValueObservation` function which avoids the need for (1), this wrapper continues to offer an advantage on points (2) and (3).
///
/// A majority of the complexity in this class comes from the fact that we turn key-value observing on keyPaths into a series of chained KeyValueObservers that we manage ourselves. This gives us more information when things change but we're re-implementing a number of things that Cococa key-value observing normally gives us for free. Generally in this class, anything involving the `tailPath` is managing observations of the path.
///
/// THREAD SAFETY:
/// This class is memory safe even when observations are triggered concurrently from different threads.
/// Do note though that while all changes are registered under the mutex, callbacks are invoked *outside* the mutex, so it is possible for callbacks to be invoked in a different order than the internal synchronized order.
/// In general, this shouldn't be a problem (since key-value observing is not itself synchronized so there *isn't* an authoritative ordering). However, this may cause unexpected behavior if you invoke `cancel` on this class. If you `cancel` the `KeyValueObserver` while it is concurrently processing changes on another thread, this might result in callback invocations occurring *after* the call to `cancel`. This will only happen if the changes associated with those callbacks were received *before* the `cancel` - it's just the callback that's getting invoked later.
