/// This protocol exists to keep alive and terminate-at-will asynchronous and ongoing tasks. It is an
/// implementation of the "Disposable" pattern.
///
/// While conformance to this protocol requires just one function, conforming to this protocol also signals three important traits:
///    1. instances manage an underlying resource
///	 2. the resource will last until one the first of the following end-conditions occurs:
///        a. The resource terminates on its own
///        b. All references to the Lifetime instance are released
///        c. The `cancel()` function is invoked
///
/// ideally, as well:
///
///    3. no further effects or actions of any kind will occur after the first end-condition is registered in the
///       resource's context, no further messages or notifications sent or received, no resurrection possible
///    4. any subsequent end conditions after the first are safe and have no effect
///    5. if Self is a reference type, `cancel` should be explicitly invoked on deinit
///    6. `cancel` should invoke `cancel` on any owned child Lifetime instances
///
/// Examples of violations of the last 4 points exist be should be kept rare.

	/// This a mutating method and should be called only in executation contexts where changing `self` is threadsafe.
