/// Describes 7 key execution context types. The six most common exist as a pair between a sychronous and asynchronous version:
///  * immediate and concurrentAsync
///  * mutex and serialAsync
///  * thread and threadAsync
/// With the final context being an additional variation on mutex:
///  * recursiveMutex
///
/// This list of of execution context types should *not* be considered exhaustive so in general, it is better to interrogate the boolean properties in which you're interested.
/// These properties are currently:
///  * isImmediate[InCurrentContext|Always]
///  * isReentrant
///  * isConcurrent
public enum ExecutionType {
	/// This execution type models a simple function invocation.
	///	* completes before `invoke` returns (immediate)
	///   * applies no mutex so nested calls to `invoke` will succeed (reentrant)
	///   * will let parallel calls run at the same time (concurrent)
	///   * invocation always inherits the caller's context (nest always)
	/// e.g. directly calling
	case immediate
	
	/// This execution type models a global concurrent work pool.
	///	* runs outside the current context and might not complete before `invoke` returns (asynchronous)
	///   * involves no mutex so nested calls to `invokeSync` are permitted (reentrant)
	///   * will let parallel calls run at the same time (concurrent)
	///   * normally async but `invokeSync` is invoked from the calling context (sync nests)
	/// e.g. DispatchQueue.global().async
	case concurrentAsync
	
	/// This execution type models a scoped non-recursive mutex.
	///	* completes before `invoke` returns (immediate)
	///   * applies a non-reentrant mutex so nested calls to `invoke` will deadlock (non-reentrant)
	///   * will serialize parallel calls to run one at a time (serial)
	///   * invocation always inherits the caller's context (nest always)
	/// e.g. dispatchQueue.sync
	case mutex
	
	/// This execution type models a scoped recursive mutex. The associated test function returns `true` if the `invoke` or `invokeSync` function can be elided (replaced by direct invocation, since the current context is known to be inside the mutex).
	///	* completes before `invoke` returns (immediate)
	///   * applies a mutex but a nested `invoke` will safely re-enter the mutex (reentrant)
	///   * will serialize parallel calls to run one at a time (serial)
	///   * invocation always inherits the caller's context (nest always)
	/// e.g. NSRecursiveLock.lock(before:)
	case recursiveMutex(() -> Bool)
	
	/// This execution type models a thread. The associated test function returns `true` if the `invoke` or `invokeSync` function can be elided (replaced by direct invocation, since the current context is known to be inside the thread).
	///	* if test function returns true, then `invoke` is immediate in the current context, otherwise asychronous (immediate/asynchronous)
	///   * nested calls to `invoke` are permitted since they will simply be run immediately (reentrant)
	///   * will serialize parallel calls to run one at a time (serial)
	///   * invocation only inherits the caller's context if test function returns true in current context (nest thread)
	/// e.g. `if Thread.isMainThread { /* do work */ } else { DispatchQueue.main.async { /* do work */ }`
	case thread(() -> Bool)
	
	/// This execution type models a thread on which work is typically performed asynchronously. The associated test function returns `true` if the `invoke` or `invokeSync` function can be elided (replaced by direct invocation, since the current context is known to be inside the thread).
	///	* `invoke` is always asynchronous (asynchronous)
	///   * detects when it is already on the current thread so nested calls to `invokeSync` will not deadlock (reentrant)
	///   * will serialize parallel calls to run one at a time (serial)
	///   * normally async but `invokeSync` nests if already on its thread (nest syncThread)
	/// e.g. DispatchQueue.main.async
	case threadAsync(() -> Bool)
	
	/// This execution type models an asynchronous resource that lacks any synchronous access.
	///	* runs outside the current context and might not complete before `invoke` returns (asynchronous)
	///   * applies a non-reentrant mutex so nested calls to `invokeSync` will deadlock (non-reentrant)
	///   * will serialize parallel calls to run one at a time (serial)
	///   * invocation never inherits the caller's context (nest no)
	/// e.g. a serial resource that offers a `performAsync(_:() -> Void)` but doesn't offer a `performSync(_:() -> Void)`
	case serialAsync
